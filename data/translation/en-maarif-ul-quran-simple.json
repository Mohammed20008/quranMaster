The fact is that the guilty do not succeed."},"10:18":{"t":"And they worship, besides Allah, what can neither harm them, nor benefit them, and they say, \"These are our intercessors with Allah.\" Say, \"Are you informing Allah of what He does not know to exist in the heavens or on the earth?\" Pure is He, and far higher than their ascribing of partners to Him."},"10:19":{"t":"And people were but one community; later, they differed. But for a word from your Lord that had already come, there would have come a decision between them on what they used to differ."},"10:20":{"t":"And they say, \"Why is it that no sign has been sent down to him from his Lord?\" Say, \"The Unseen is only for Allah. So, wait. I am waiting with you.\""},"10:21":{"t":"Once We cause people to taste a blessing after a hardship having afflicted them, they at once start devising plans against Our verses. Say, Allah is swifter in implementing His plan. Indeed, Our messengers (angels) record whatever you intrigue."},"10:22":{"t":"He is the One who enables you to travel on land and at sea, until when you are in the boats and they sail with those on board under a good wind and they are pleased with it, there comes upon them a violent wind, and the wave comes upon them from many sides. And (when) they think that they are encircled, they pray to Allah, having faith in Him alone, (and say,) \"If You deliver us from this, we shall be grateful indeed.\""},"10:23":{"t":"But when He delivers them, they at once start rebelling on the earth wrongfully. 0 people, your rebellion is, in fact, against your own selves. (It is nothing but) an enjoyment of the worldly life. Therefore, to Us you are to return, then We shall tell you what you have been doing."},"10:24":{"t":"The example of worldly life is just like the water We sent down from the heavens, then the vegetation of the earth, eaten by men and cattle, until when the earth took on its ornament and was fully adorned, and its people thought that they had control over it, Our command came to it at night or by day, and We turned it into a stubble, as if it had not been there a day earlier. This is how We elaborate the verses for a people who reflect."},"10:25":{"t":"And Allah invites (people) to the Abode of Peace and brings whom He wills to a straight path."},"10:26":{"t":"For those who do good there is the best, and something more, and neither darkness nor disgrace shall cover their faces. Those are the people of Paradise. Therein they shall live forever."},"10:27":{"t":"As for those who commit evils, the recompense of each evil shall be similar to that evil, and disgrace shall cover them. For them, there is none to save from Allah. Their faces seem to be covered with layers of a dark night. Those are the people of the Fire. Therein they shall live forever."},"10:28":{"t":"And (forget not) the Day We shall gather them together, then We shall say to those who associated partners with Allah, \"Wait in your place, you and your associate-gods.\" Then We shall cause a split between them, and their associate-gods will say, \"It was not us that you worshipped."},"10:29":{"t":"So, Allah is enough as witness between us and between you. We were certainly unaware of your worship.\""},"10:30":{"t":"Thereupon, everyone shall assess what one sent ahead, and they will be sent back to Allah, their true Lord, and lost to them shall be what they used to coin."},"10:31":{"t":"Say, \"Who gives you sustenance from the heavens and the earth? Or, who controls the (powers of) hearing and seeing? And who brings forth the living from the dead, and brings forth the dead from the living? And who manages everything?\" They will say, \"Allah.\" Then, (you) say, \"Would you not, then, fear Allah?\""},"10:32":{"t":"So, that is Allah, your Lord in truth. And what is there, after truth, but error? Where, then, are you being diverted?"},"10:33":{"t":"This is how the Word of your Lord that they will not believe is established against those who sinned."},"10:34":{"t":"Say, \"Is there any one from your associate-gods who originates the creation, then brings it again? Where then, are you being turned away?\""},"10:35":{"t":"Say, \"Is there any one from your associate-gods who guides to the truth?\" Say, \"Allah guides to the truth. Is, then, He who guides to the truth more worthy of being obeyed, or he who has no guidance unless he is guided? So, what is the matter with you? How do you judge things?"},"10:36":{"t":"And most of them follow nothing but conjecture. Surely, conjecture does not suffice against the truth in any way. Certainly, Allah is fully aware of what they do."},"10:37":{"t":"And this Qur'an is not such as could be made by some-one other than Allah, but it is a confirmation of what has been before it, and an elaboration of what is writ-ten. There is no doubt in it. It is from the Lord of the worlds."},"10:38":{"t":"Or, do they say that he has made it up? Say, \"Then, bring a Surah like it, and call whomsoever you can be-sides Allah, if you are true.\""},"10:39":{"t":"But they have belied something of which they had no comprehensive knowledge, while its implications have not yet come to them. Likewise belied those before them. So, look how was the fate of the unjust."},"10:40":{"t":"And among them there are those who believe in it, and among them there are others who do not believe in it. And your Lord has the best knowledge about the mischief-makers."},"10:41":{"t":"And if they belie you, say, \"For me, my deed, and for you, your deed. You are not accountable for what I do and I am not accountable for what you do.\""},"10:42":{"t":"And among them there are those who listen to you. Would you, then, make the deaf hear, even when they lack understanding?"},"10:43":{"t":"And among them there are those who look at you. Would you, then, guide the blind even when they have no insight?"},"10:44":{"t":"Surely, Allah does not do wrong to people at all, but the people do wrong to their own selves."},"10:45":{"t":"And the Day when He will gather them, (they will feel) like they had not stayed for any longer than a fraction of a day as they will recognize each other. Losers, in-deed, are those who deny that they will ever face Allah, and they are not on the right path."},"10:46":{"t":"So, no matter whether We show you some of what We warn them of, or We take you back to Us (before it), in any case, they have to return to Us. Then, Allah is witness to what they do."},"10:47":{"t":"And for every people there is a messenger. So, when their messenger comes, the matter will be decided between them with justice, and they shall not be wronged."},"10:48":{"t":"And they say, \"When will this promise be (fulfilled) if you are true?\""},"10:49":{"t":"Say, \"I have no power to bring a harm or a benefit to myself, except what Allah wills. For every people there is an appointed time. When their time comes, they will not be late for a moment, nor will they be earlier."},"10:50":{"t":"Say, \"Just tell me, if His punishment befalls you at night or by day, what is there in it that the sinners wish to come soon?"},"10:51":{"t":"Is it then when it befalls you that you will believe in it? Now (you believe)? And you have been asking for it to come sooner!\""},"10:52":{"t":"Then it will be said to the unjust, \"Taste the punishment lasting forever. You shall not be punished except for what you have been earning.\""},"10:53":{"t":"And they want you to tell them whether it is true. Say, \"Yes, by my Lord, it is true. And you cannot frustrate (His plan).\""},"10:54":{"t":"And if anyone who did wrong possesses all that there is on earth, he would ransom himself with it. And they will conceal their remorse when they will see the punishment. And the matter will be decided between them with justice and they will not be wronged."},"10:55":{"t":"Look! To Allah belongs all that there is in the heavens and the earth. Look! Allah's promise is certainly true, but most of them do not know."},"10:56":{"t":"He gives life and brings death, and to Him you shall be returned."},"10:57":{"t":"O men, there has come to you an advice from your Lord, and a cure for what is in your hearts, and guidance and mercy for the believers."},"10:58":{"t":"Say, \"With the grace of Allah and with His mercy\" - with these they should rejoice. It is far better than what they accumulate."},"10:59":{"t":"Say, \"Tell me, whatever provision Allah has sent down for you, you have made out from it lawful and unlawful.\" Say, \"Has Allah permitted you or are you fabricating a lie on Allah?\""},"10:60":{"t":"And what is the assumption of those who fabricate a lie on Allah (about) the Day of Doom? Surely, Allah is all gracious to people, but most of them are not grateful."},"10:61":{"t":"And in whatever condition you are, and whatever portion of the Qur'an you recite therein, and whatever work you (all) do, We are present before you when you are involved in it. And hidden from your Lord is nothing even to the measure of a particle on the earth or in the heavens. And there is nothing smaller or greater that is not there in the clear Book."},"10:62":{"t":"Listen, the friends of Allah shall have no fear nor shall they grieve"},"10:63":{"t":"those who have believed and have been fearful of Allah."},"10:64":{"t":"For them there is the good news in the worldly life and in the Hereafter - there is no change in the words of Allah - that is the great achievement."},"10:65":{"t":"And what they say should not make you grieve. Surely, all power belongs to Allah. He is All-Hearing, All Knowing."},"10:66":{"t":"Listen, to Allah belong all those in the heavens and all those on the earth. And what do follow those who invoke associate-gods other than Allah? They follow nothing but whims and do nothing but make conjectures."},"10:67":{"t":"He is the One who made for you the night, so that you may have rest in it, and (made) the day to see. Indeed, there are signs therein for a people who listen."},"10:68":{"t":"They say, \"Allah has got a son.\" Pure is He. He is Self-Sufficient. To Him belongs what is in the heavens and what is in the earth. You have no proof for it. Do you allege about Allah what you do not know?"},"10:69":{"t":"Say: Those who fabricate against Allah shall not prosper."},"10:70":{"t":"A little enjoyment in this world then, to Us is their return, then, We shall make them taste the severe punishment, because they used to disbelieve."},"10:71":{"t":"And recite to them the story of Nuh, when he said to his people, \"0 my people, if it is hard on you that I stay (with you) and give (you) advice through the signs of Allah, then, in Allah I place my trust. So, decide your matter along with your partners, then, your design should not be a matter of regret to you, then carry it out against me and give me no respite."},"10:72":{"t":"So, if you turn away, then, I have asked for no reward from you. My reward is with none except Allah, and I have been commanded to be among those who submit.\""},"10:73":{"t":"Then they belied him, and We saved him and those with him in the Ark and made them the successors and drowned those who belied Our signs. So look how was the fate of those who were warned."},"10:74":{"t":"Then, after him, We sent messengers to their peoples, and they came to them with clear signs, but they were not to believe in what they had belied earlier. This is how We seal the hearts of the transgressors."},"10:75":{"t":"Then, after them, We sent Musa and Harun with Our signs to Pharaoh and his group, but they showed arrogance. And they surely were a guilty people."},"10:76":{"t":"So, when Truth came to them from Us, they said, \"It is certainly a clear magic.\""},"10:77":{"t":"Musa said, \"Do you say (this) about the Truth when it came to you? Is this magic, while the magicians do not succeed?\""},"10:78":{"t":"They said, \"Have you come to us that you may turn us from what we found our fathers on, and that you both have supremacy on earth? We are not going to believe in you.\""},"10:79":{"t":"And the Pharaoh said, \"Bring to me every knowledgeable magician.\""},"10:80":{"t":"So, when the magicians came, Musa said to them, \"Throw what you have to throw.\""},"10:81":{"t":"So, when they threw, Musa said, \"What you have come up with is magic. Allah will certainly nullify it. It is sure that Allah does not let sustain the work of the mischief-makers."},"10:82":{"t":"And Allah establishes the truth through His words, even though the guilty may dislike it."},"10:83":{"t":"Then, except an offspring of his people, no one believed in Musa for the fear of Pharaoh and his group, lest should prosecute them. And the Pharaoh was high-handed in the land and he was of those who crossed all limits."},"10:84":{"t":"And Musa said, \" 0 my people, if you have believed in Allah, then, in Him put your trust if you are obedient.\""},"10:85":{"t":"So, they said, \"In Allah we have put our trust: Our Lord, do not make us a victim of the unjust people,"},"10:86":{"t":"and save us, through Yourercy, from the disbelieving people.\""},"10:87":{"t":"And We revealed to Musa and his brother: \"Have houses for your people in Egypt and make your houses worship oriented, and establish , Oalah, and give good tidings to the believers.\""},"10:88":{"t":"And Musa said, \"Our Lord, You have given Pharaoh and his group glamour and riches in the worldly life, so that, our Lord, they mislead (people) from Your path. Our Lord, obliterate their riches and harden their hearts, so that they may not come to believe until they witness the painful punishment.\""},"10:89":{"t":"Allah said, \"The prayer of you both has been granted, so stand firm and never follow the way of those who do not know.\""},"10:90":{"t":"And We made the children of Isra'il cross the sea. So, Pharaoh and his troops chased them in transgression and hostility, until when he was about to drown, he said, \"I believe that there is no god but the One in whom the children of Isra'il believe, and I am among those who submit.\""},"10:91":{"t":"Is it Now (that you come to believe) while you were rebellious before and you were among the mischief-makers?"},"10:92":{"t":"So, today, We shall save your body, so that you may become a sign for those after you. And many of the people are heedless of Our signs."},"10:93":{"t":"And surely We gave the children of Isra'il a proper place to live, and provided them with good things. So they did not disagree until knowledge came to them. Surely, Allah will decide between them on the Doomsday, about what they used to dispute."},"10:94":{"t":"So, if you are in doubt about what We have sent down to you, ask those who read the Book (revealed) before you. Surely, truth has come to you from your Lord, so never be among those who are suspicious."},"10:95":{"t":"And never be among those who have belied Our signs, lest you should be among the losers."},"10:96":{"t":"Surely, those against whom the Word of your Lord stands settled will not believe,"},"10:97":{"t":"even though every sign comes to them, unless they witness the painful punishment."},"10:98":{"t":"So, how is it that there never was a town which could have believed and its belief would have been of benefit to it except the people of Yunus .(Jonah) ! When they came to believe, We removed from them the punishment of humiliation in the worldly life and let them en-joy themselves for some time."},"10:99":{"t":"Had your Lord willed, all those on earth would have believed altogether. Would you, then, compel people, so that they become believers?"},"10:100":{"t":"And it is not for any one that he believes except with the will of Allah. And He makes filth settle on those who do not understand."},"10:101":{"t":"Say, \"Look at what is there in the heavens and the earth?\" But, signs and warners do not suffice a people who do not believe."},"10:102":{"t":"So, are they waiting for nothing short of something like the days of those who have passed before them?

Mushriks: those who associate partners to the divinity of Allah."},"10:106":{"t":"And do not invoke, other than Allah, what neither benefits you nor harms you, for, if you do so, then you will surely be one of the unjust."},"10:107":{"t":"And if Allah brings some harm to you, then, there is none to remove it except He. And if He intends to bring some good to you, then, there is none to turn His grace back. He brings it to whomever He wills from among His servants.

So, leave her free to eat in the land of Allah and do not even touch her with evil (intention), lest a near punishment should seize you.\""},"11:65":{"t":"Then they slaughtered her. So, he said, \"Enjoy yourselves in your homes for three days (only). That is a promise, not going to be false.\""},"11:66":{"t":"So, when came Our command, We saved Salih and those who believed along with Him, out of mercy from Us, and (We saved them) from the disgrace of that day. Surely, your Lord is the Powerful, the All Mighty."},"11:67":{"t":"And those who transgressed were caught by the Cry, and they were found dead in their homes, fallen on their knees,"},"11:68":{"t":"as though they had never lived there.

They said, \"Sal-am (peace).\" He said, \"Sal-am.\" Then he made no delay in bringing a roasted calf."},"11:70":{"t":"So, when he noticed their hands not reaching for it, he found them strange and felt a bit of fright from them. They said, \"Be not frightened. We have been sent to the people of Lit.\""},"11:71":{"t":"And his wife was standing (nearby). She laughed, so, We gave her the good news about Ishaq, and about Ya` qub after Ishaq."},"11:72":{"t":"She said, \"Woe is to me! Shall I give birth to a child while I am an old woman and this is my husband, an old man? This is something strange, indeed.\""},"11:73":{"t":"They said, \"Do you marvel at Allah's command? Allah's mercy and His blessings are upon you, the people of the house. Surely, He is praiseworthy, glorious.\""},"11:74":{"t":"So, when fear left Ibrahim and the happy news came to him, he started pleading before Us for the people of Lut."},"11:75":{"t":"Surely, Ibrahim is forbearing, very penitent, ever-turning to Allah."},"11:76":{"t":"0 Ibrahim! Leave it, in fact, the command of your Lord has come, and there has to come upon them a punishment, not to be turned back."},"11:77":{"t":"And when Our emissaries (angels) came to Lut, he felt uneasy and was strained in his heart on account of them, and said, \"This is a very hard day.\""},"11:78":{"t":"And his people came to him, rushing upon him. And already they used to commit evil deeds. He said, \"These are my daughters. They are far more clean for you. So, fear Allah and do not disgrace me in respect of my guests.

He said, \"What a good news! Here is a boy.\" And they kept him hidden as merchandise, while Allah was aware of what they were doing."},"12:20":{"t":"And they sold him for a paltry price, for a few silver-coins, and they were disinterested in him."},"12:21":{"t":"And the one who bought him from Egypt said to his wife, \"Make his stay graceful. He may be useful for us. Or, we may adopt him as a son.\" And thus We established Yusuf in the land, so that We should teach him the interpretation of events. And Allah is powerful in (enforcing) His command, but most of the people do not know."},"12:22":{"t":"And when he reached the prime of his age, We gave him wisdom and knowledge, and this is how We reward those good in deeds."},"12:23":{"t":"And she, in whose house he was, seduced him away from his (resisting) self and bolted the doors, and said, \"come on!\" He said, \"May Allah save me.

And he had desired her - had he not seen the proof from his Lord (he could have indulged). This We did to turn away from him evil and lewdness. Surely, he is among Our chosen slaves."},"12:25":{"t":"And they raced towards the door, and she tore his shirt from behind, and they found her master by the door. She said, \"What can be the punishment of the one who intended evil with your wife except that he be imprisoned or (given) a painful chastisement?\""},"12:26":{"t":"He said, \"It was she who sought to seduce me.\" And a witness from her family observed that if his shirt was torn up from the front side, then she is true and he is a liar;"},"12:27":{"t":"and if his shirt was torn up from behind, then she is telling a lie and he is truthful."},"12:28":{"t":"So, when he saw his shirt torn up from behind, he said, \"This is certainly a guile of yours, 0 women.

He is no human being. He is but a noble angel.'"},"12:32":{"t":"She said, \"This is he you blamed me for. Yes, I seduced him, but he abstained.

It is not for us that we associate any partners with Allah.

Destined is the matter you are asking about.\""},"12:42":{"t":"And he (Yusuf علیہ السلام) said to the one whom he believed likely to be released out of the two, \"Mention me before your master.' Then, the Satan made him forget to mention him to his master. So, he (Yusuf علیہ السلام) remained in prison for a few years."},"12:43":{"t":"And the king said, \"I have seen (in a dream) seven fat cows being eaten by seven lean ones, and seven ears of grain which are green and (seven) others which are dry. 0 people, tell me about my dream, if you do interpret dreams.\""},"12:44":{"t":"They said, \" (It seems to be) a mishmash of dreams, and we do not know the interpretation of dreams.\""},"12:45":{"t":"And said the one who was released out of the two and re-called (Ysuf) after a long time, 'I shall tell you its interpretation.

So, what you have harvested, leave it in its ear, except a little which you eat."},"12:48":{"t":"Then there shall come after that seven hard years which shall eat up what you have stored for them, except a little which you preserve (to sow)."},"12:49":{"t":"Then there shall come after that a year in which people shall have rains and in which they shall extract juices.\""},"12:50":{"t":"And the king said, 'Bring him to me.\" So, when the messenger came to him, he said, \"Go back to your lord and ask him, ` What about the women who cut their hands?' Surely, my Lord knows their guile well.\""},"12:51":{"t":"He (the king) said, \"What was your case, 0 women, when you seduced Yusuf?\" They said, \"God forbid, we know of no evil in him.\" The governor's wife said, 'Now the truth has come to light. I did seduce him, and he is of the truthful.\""},"12:52":{"t":"(Then Yusuf said,) \"That was because he (the governor) may know that I did not betray him in his absence and that Allah does not lead the guile of betrayers to success.\""},"12:53":{"t":"\"And I do not absolve my inner self of blame. Surely, man's inner self often incites to evil, unless my Lord shows mercy. Certainly, my Lord is the Most-Forgiving, Very-Merciful.\""},"12:54":{"t":"And the king said, 'Bring him to me, and I shall make him (work) for myself alone.\" So, when he (the king) talked to him (Yusuf علیہ السلام), he said, 'Today you are with us firmly accommodated and trusted.\""},"12:55":{"t":"He said, \"Appoint me to (supervise) the treasures of the land. I am indeed a knowledgeable keeper.\""},"12:56":{"t":"And thus We gave Yusuf (علیہ السلام) power in the land. He could settle there wherever he wished. We extend Our mercy to whomsoever We will, and We do not waste the reward of those who are good in deeds."},"12:57":{"t":"And the reward of the Hereafter is surely better for those who believe and keep fearing Allah."},"12:58":{"t":"And came the brothers of Yusuf (علیہ السلام) and appeared before him. He recognized them, while they were not to recognize him."},"12:59":{"t":"And when he equipped them with their provisions, he said, 'Bring to me your step brother from your father's side. Do you not see that I give full measure and I am the best of hosts?"},"12:60":{"t":"Still, if you do not bring him to me, then you deserve no measure from me, nor shall you come even close to me."},"12:61":{"t":"They said, \"We shall persuade his father about him and we will certainly do it.\""},"12:62":{"t":"And he (Yusuf) said to his boys, \"put their capital in their camel-packs. Perhaps they will recognize it when they are back in their family. Perhaps they will come back.\""},"12:63":{"t":"So, when they returned to their father, they said, \"0 our father, the (required) measure (of grain) has been with-held from us, therefore, send our brother with us, so that we may receive our full measure. And, of course, we are his guards.\""},"12:64":{"t":"He said, \"Shall I trust you about him as I trusted you earlier about his brother? Well, Allah is the best guardian and He is the most-merciful of all the merciful.\""},"12:65":{"t":"And when they opened their baggage, they found their capital given back to them. They said, \"Our father, what else do we want? Here is our capital given back to us, and we shall bring food to our family, protect our brother and add the measure of one camel more. That is an easy measure.\""},"12:66":{"t":"He said, \"I shall never send him with you until you give me a pledge in the name of Allah that you will definitely bring him back to me, unless you are overpowered (by circumstances).\" So, when they gave him their pledge, he said, \"Allah is watchful over what we say.\""},"12:67":{"t":"And he said, \"0 my sons, do not enter (the city) all of you from the same gate, rather, enter from different gates. And I cannot help you in any way against (the will of) Allah. Sovereignty belongs to none but Allah. In Him I place my trust, and in Him should trust those who trust.\""},"12:68":{"t":"And when they entered (the city) in the manner their father had advised them, he could not help them in any way against (the will of) Allah, but it was just an urge in the heart of Ya` qub which he satisfied. He was a man of knowledge; because We had taught him, but most of the people do not know."},"12:69":{"t":"And when they came to Yusuf, he lodged his brother (Benyamin) with himself. He said, \"Behold, I am your brother! So do not grieve for what they have been doing.\""},"12:70":{"t":"Later, when he equipped them with their provisions, he placed the bowl in the camel-pack of his brother. Then, an announcer shouted out, \"0 people of the caravan, you are thieves.\""},"12:71":{"t":"Turning towards them, they said, \"What are you missing?\""},"12:72":{"t":"They said, \"We are missing the measuring-bowl of the king, and whoever brings it back shall deserve a camel-load, and I stand surety for it.\""},"12:73":{"t":"They said, 'We swear by Allah, you certainly know that we did not come to make mischief in the land, nor have we ever been thieves.\""},"12:74":{"t":"They said, 'at is the punishment, if you are liars?'"},"12:75":{"t":"They said, \"It's punishment is that he, in whose baggage it is found, shall himself be the punishment. This is how we punish the wrongdoers.\""},"12:76":{"t":"So, he started with their bags before the bag of his brother, then, recovered it from the bag of his brother. This is how We planned for Yusuf. He had no right to take his brother according to the law of the king, unless Allah so willed. We elevate in ranks whom so We will. And above every man who has knowledge, there is someone more knowledgeable."},"12:77":{"t":"They said, If he commits theft, then, a brother of his has committed theft before.\" So Yusuf kept it (his reaction) to himself and did not reveal it to them. He said, 'You are even worse in position. And Allah knows best of what you allege.\""},"12:78":{"t":"They said, \"0 ` Aziz, he has a father, a very old man. So, take one of us in his place. We see you are a generous man.\""},"12:79":{"t":"He said, \"God forbid that we keep anyone except the one with whom we have found our thing, otherwise we shall be unjust.\""},"12:80":{"t":"So when they lost hope in him, they went aside for consultation. The oldest of them said, 'Do you not know that your father has taken pledge from you in the name of Allah, while you had defaulted earlier in the case of Yusuf. So, I shall never leave this land unless my father permits me or Allah decides about me. And He is the best of all judges."},"12:81":{"t":"Go back to your father and say, ` Our father, your son has committed theft, and we do not testify except what we know, and we could not guard against the unseen."},"12:82":{"t":"And ask (the people of) the town in which we have been and the caravan with which we have come, and surely we are truthful.\""},"12:83":{"t":"He (Ya` qub) said, \"Rather, your inner desires have seduced you to something. So, patience is best. Hopefully, Allah may bring them all together. Surely, He is the All-Knowing, All-Wise.\""},"12:84":{"t":"And he turned away from them and said, 'How sad I am about Yusuf' and his eyes turned white with sorrow and he was suppressing (his anger and grief)."},"12:85":{"t":"They said, 'By God, you will not stop remembering Yusuf until you collapse or perish.\""},"12:86":{"t":"He said, \"I complain of my anguish and sorrow to none but Allah, and I know from Allah what you do not know."},"12:87":{"t":"0 my sons, go and search for Yusuf and his brother, and do not lose hope in the mercy of Allah. In fact, only the infidels lose hope in the mercy of Allah.\""},"12:88":{"t":"So, when they came to him (Yusuf), they said, \"0 ` Aziz, distress has befallen us and our family, and we have brought a capital of very little worth. So, give us the full measure and be charitable to us. Surely, Allah rewards the charitable.\""},"12:89":{"t":"He said, \"Do you know what you did to Yusuf and his brother when you acted ignorant?\""},"12:90":{"t":"They said, \"Are you really the Yusuf?\" He said, \"I am Yusuf, and this is my brother. Allah has been very kind to us. Surely, whoever fears Allah and observes patience, then Allah does not waste the reward of the good-doers.\""},"12:91":{"t":"They said, 'By God, Allah has given to you preference over us, and we were surely in error.\""},"12:92":{"t":"He said, No reproach upon you today. May Allah forgive you, and He is the most merciful of all the merciful."},"12:93":{"t":"Go with this shirt of mine and put it over the face of my father, and he will turn into a sighted man. And bring to me all your family.\""},"12:94":{"t":"And when the caravan set out, their father said, \"I sense the scent of Yusuf if you do not take me to be senile.\""},"12:95":{"t":"They said, 'By God, you are still in your old fallacy!\""},"12:96":{"t":"So, when came the man with good news, he put it (the shirt) on his face, and he turned into a sighted man. He (Ya` qub) said, 'Did I not tell you that I know from Allah what you do not know?'"},"12:97":{"t":"They said, 'Our father, pray to Allah to forgive us our sins. Surely, we have been wrong.\""},"12:98":{"t":"He said, 'I shall pray to my Lord to forgive you. Surely, He is the Most-Forgiving, Very-Merciful.\""},"12:99":{"t":"Later, when they came to Yusuf, he placed his parents near himself and said, \"Enter Egypt, God willing, in peace.\""},"12:100":{"t":"And he raised his parents up on the throne, and they all fell before him in prostration.

Indeed He is the most Forgiving, Very-Merciful."},"28:17":{"t":"He (Musa) said, \"0 my Lord, since You have favoured me, I will never be a supporter of the sinners.\""},"28:18":{"t":"Then next morning he was fearful, waiting (for what comes next) when the man who sought his help the day before, shouted to him for help (again). Musa said to him, \"You are surely an apparent trouble-maker.\""},"28:19":{"t":"Thereafter when he intended to grasp at the one who was an enemy to both of them, the latter said, \"0 Musa, do you want to kill me as you have killed a person yesterday? You intend nothing but to become a tyrant in the land, and you do not intend to be one of the peace-makers.\""},"28:20":{"t":"And there came a man running, from the farthest part of the city. He said, \"The chiefs are counselling each other about you, so that they kill you. So, leave (the city). I am one of your well-wishers.\""},"28:21":{"t":"So, he went out of it (the city) in a state of fear, waiting (for what comes next). He said, \"0 my Lord, save me from the cruel people.\""},"28:22":{"t":"And when he set out towards Madyan, he said, \"I hope my Lord will guide me to the straight path\"."},"28:23":{"t":"And when he arrived at the waters of Madyan, he found a large number of people watering (their animals) and found, aloof from them, two women keeping back (their animals). He said, \"What is the matter with you?\" They said, \"We cannot water (our animals) unless the shepherds bring (their animals) back and our father is very old man.\""},"28:24":{"t":"So he (Musa) watered (their animals) for their sake, then he turned to a shade and said, \"0 my Lord, I am in need of whatever good you send down to me.\""},"28:25":{"t":"Then one of the two women came to him, walking with shyness. She said, \"My father is calling you, so that he rewards you with something in return of your watering for us. So when he (Musa) came to him (the father of the women) and narrated to him the whole story, the latter said, \"Do not fear; you have escaped from the wrongdoing people.\""},"28:26":{"t":"One of the two women said, 'Dear father, hire him; the best man you hire is the one who is strong, trustworthy.\""},"28:27":{"t":"He (the father) said (to Musa), \"I wish to marry one of these two daughters of mine to you on the condition that you serve me for eight years. Then if you complete ten (years) it will be of your own accord. And I do not want to put you in any trouble; you will find me, Inshallah (God-willing) one of the righteous.\""},"28:28":{"t":"He (Musa) said, \"This is (done) between me and you. Whichever of the two terms I fulfill, there should be no excess against me, and Allah is witness to what we are saying.\""},"28:29":{"t":"So, when Musa completed the term and set forth with his wife, he noticed a fire from the direction of the (mount) Tur, he said to his wife, \"Stay here; I have noticed a fire. May be I bring to you some information or an ember from the fire, so that you may warm yourself.\""},"28:30":{"t":"So when he came to it, he was called by a voice coming from a side of the right valley in the blessed ground, from the tree, saying, \"O Musa, I am Allah, the Lord of the worlds.\""},"28:31":{"t":"And saying; 'Throw down your staff.\" So when he saw it moving as if it were a snake, he turned back in retreat and did not look back. (Allah said to him), \"0 Musa come forward and do not fear; you are one of those in peace."},"28:32":{"t":"Insert your hand into your bosom, and it will come out white without any evil (disease), and press your arm to your side for (removing) fear. Thus these are two proofs from your Lord (sent) to the Pharaoh and his chiefs. Indeed they are transgressing people.\""},"28:33":{"t":"He said, \"My Lord, I have killed a person from them; therefore I fear that they will kill me."},"28:34":{"t":"And my brother Harun is more fluent with his tongue than I am; so send him with me as a helper who will bear me out. I am afraid, they will belie me.\""},"28:35":{"t":"He (Allah) said, \"We will make your arm stronger through (the help of) your brother and will make you have the upper hand, so they will not reach you (to cause any harm) because of Our signs. You both and those who follow you will be victorious.\""},"28:36":{"t":"So when Musa came to them with Our clear signs, they said, \"This is nothing but a forged magic, and we did not hear about it among our forefathers.\""},"28:37":{"t":"And Musa said, \"My Lord knows best the one who has come with guidance from Him and who is going to have the best end of the abode. It is certain that the wrongdoers will not succeed.\""},"28:38":{"t":"And the Pharaoh said, \"0 chiefs, I do not know of any god for you other than me. So kindle for me, 0 Haman, a fire on the clay (to bake bricks) and build for me a tower, so that I may look on to the God of Musa. And I deem him to be one of the liars.\""},"28:39":{"t":"And he and his hosts became over-proud in the land without justification and thought that they would not be returned to Us."},"28:40":{"t":"So We seized him and his hosts and threw them into the sea. Look then, how was the fate of the wrongdoers."},"28:41":{"t":"And We had made them leaders who called (people) towards hell. And on the Day of Judgment they will not be helped."},"28:42":{"t":"And We made a curse to pursue them in this world; and on the Day of Judgment they will be among those treated badly."},"28:43":{"t":"And We gave Muss, after We destroyed the earlier generations, the Book having insights for people and a guidance and mercy, so that they may take to advice."},"28:44":{"t":"And you (0 Muhammad) were not there at the Western side (of. the mount Tur) when We delegated the matter to Mass, nor were you among those present,"},"28:45":{"t":"but We created generations (after him) and a long time passed over them. And you were not dwelling among the people of Madyan, reciting Our verses to them, but it is We who do send messengers."},"28:46":{"t":"And you were not at the side of (the mount) Tur when We called (Mass), but it (your prophethood through which you knew all this) is a mercy from your Lord, so that you warn a people to whom no warner has come before you, that they may take to advice."},"28:47":{"t":"And (We would not have sent the messenger) if there would have been no apprehension that, in case they suffered a calamity because of what their hands sent ahead, they would say, \"Our Lord, why did You not send a messenger to us, so that we would be among the believers?\""},"28:48":{"t":"But when the Truth came to them from Us, they said, \"Why has he (the messenger) not been given (a book) similar to what Masa had been given?\" Is it not that they denied what Musa had been given before? They said, 'Both (Qur'an and Torah) are works of magic that support each other.\" And they said, \"We disbelieve each one of them.\""},"28:49":{"t":"Say, \"Then bring a book from Allah which is better than both, in guidance, and I shall follow it, if you are true.\""},"28:50":{"t":"So if they do not respond to you, be sure that they are only following their desires. And who is more astray than the one who follows his desire without guidance from Allah. Surely Allah does not take the wrongdoing people to the right path."},"28:51":{"t":"And We have conveyed (Our) word to them one after the other, ‘so that they may take to advice."},"28:52":{"t":"As for those to whom We gave the Book before this, they believe in it (Qur'an)."},"28:53":{"t":"And when this (Qur'an) is recited to them, they say, \"We believe in it. It is the truth from our Lord. And we are the ones who submitted (to it) even before it (was revealed).\""},"28:54":{"t":"Such people will be given their reward twice, because they observed patience. And they repel evil with good, and spend from what We have given to them."},"28:55":{"t":"And when they hear absurd talk, they withdraw from it and say, \"Our deeds are for us and your deeds are for you. Peace be on you. We do not seek (the way of) the ignorant.\""},"28:56":{"t":"You cannot give guidance to whomsoever you wish, but Allah gives guidance to whomsoever He wills, and He knows best the ones who are on the right path."},"28:57":{"t":"And they said, “ if we follow the guidance with you O Muhammad), we will be driven out of our land.\" Is it not that We have established them in the peaceful Haram (sanctuary) to which the fruits of everything are drawn as a provision from Us? But most of them do not know."},"28:58":{"t":"And how many a town have We destroyed that were over-proud of their means of living. So, those are their habitations which were never inhabited after them except a few, and We alone were the inheritors."},"28:59":{"t":"And your Lord is not to destroy the towns unless he sends to their central place a messenger who recites to them Our verses. And We are not to destroy the towns except when their people are wrongdoers."},"28:60":{"t":"And whatever of anything you are given is (no more than) an enjoyment of the worldly life and its decoration, and that which is with Allah is much better and far more lasting. So do you not understand?"},"28:61":{"t":"Is then the one, to whom We have made a good promise which he is going to meet, like the one whom We have given the benefit of enjoying the worldly life, then on the Day of Judgment he will be among those arraigned?"},"28:62":{"t":"And (remember) the Day when He will call them and say, \"Where are My 'partners' you used to claim?"},"28:63":{"t":"Those against whom the word will come true will say, \"Our Lord, these are the ones whom we led astray. We led them astray as we ourselves went astray. We negate before you our responsibility (in respect of them); it was not we (alone) whom they worshipped."},"28:64":{"t":"And it will be said, \"Call upon your co-gods.\" So they will call upon them, but they will not respond to them, and they will see the punishment. Would that they had taken the right path!"},"28:65":{"t":"And (remember) the Day when He (Allah) will call them and say, \"What response did you give to the messengers?\""},"28:66":{"t":"So the events will be obscured to them and they will not (be able to) ask each other."},"28:67":{"t":"As for the one who repents and becomes a believer and acts righteously, it is likely that he will be among the successful."},"28:68":{"t":"And your Lord creates what He wills and chooses. Choice is not with them. Pure is Allah and far higher than their ascribing of partners to Him."},"28:69":{"t":"And your Lord knows what their hearts conceal and what they reveal."},"28:70":{"t":"And He is Allah. There is no god but He. To Him belongs the praise in the beginning and at the end, and He alone has the right to judge, and to Him you are to be returned."},"28:71":{"t":"Say, 'Tell me, if Allah makes night continuing upon you forever upto the Day of Judgment, which god, other than Allah, would bring to you light? Then, do you not listen?\""},"28:72":{"t":"Say, \"Tell me, if Allah makes the day continuing upon you forever upto the Day of Judgment, which god, other than Allah, would bring to you night in which you may have comfort? Then, do you not see?\""},"28:73":{"t":"And it is out of His mercy that He has made day and night for you, so that you may have comfort therein and so that you may search for His grace, and so that you may be grateful."},"28:74":{"t":"And (remember) the Day when He (Allah) will call them (the disbelievers) and say, 'Where are My 'partners' you used to claim?\""},"28:75":{"t":"And We will draw out a witness from every community (to prove their disbelief) and will say, 'Bring your proof'. Then they will know that truth is from Allah, and all that they used to forge shall vanish from them."},"28:76":{"t":"Surely, Qarun was from the people of Musa (علیہ السلام) ، rebelled against them. And We had given to him such treasures as their keys would weigh too heavy for a strong group of people. (Remember) when his people said to him, \"Do not exult. Surely, Allah does not like the exultant."},"28:77":{"t":"And seek the (betterment of) the Ultimate Abode with what Allah has given to you, and do not neglect your share from this world, and do good as Allah did good to you, and do not seek to make mischief in the land. Surely, Allah does not like the mischief- makers.\""},"28:78":{"t":"He said, \"This is given to me because of the knowledge (I have) with me.\" Did he not know that Allah had destroyed, from the generations before him, those who were stronger than him in power and greater than him in multitude? And the sinners have not to be asked about their sins."},"28:79":{"t":"Then (once) he came out before his people in his embellishment, said those who are desirous of the worldly life, \"Would that we had the like of what Qarun has been given! He is a man of great fortune indeed.\""},"28:80":{"t":"And said those who were given knowledge, \"Woe to you, Allah's reward is much better for the one who believes and acts righteously. And this is given to none but to those who observe restraint.\""},"28:81":{"t":"Then We made him and his home sink into the earth. So there was no group for him who could help him against Allah, nor was he one of those who defend themselves."},"28:82":{"t":"And those who wished to be in his position the day before, started saying, \"Oh, it seems that Allah extends provision to whom He wills and straitens (for whom He wills). Had Allah not favoured us, He would have made us sink (too). Oh, it seems that the infidels do not succeed.\""},"28:83":{"t":"As for that Ultimate Abode (the Hereafter), We assign it to those who intend neither haughtiness on earth nor mischief. And the (best) end is for the God-fearing."},"28:84":{"t":"Whoever brings good deed shall have better than it, and whoever brings evil deed, then those who commit evils shall not be punished except for what they used to do."},"28:85":{"t":"Surely the One who has enjoined the Qur’ an upon you will surely bring you back to a place of return. Say, \"My Lord knows best the one who has come with guidance and the one who is in manifest error.\""},"28:86":{"t":"And you were not expecting that the Book would be sent down to you, but it was a mercy from your Lord. So, never be a supporter for the infidels."},"28:87":{"t":"And let them not prevent you from Allah's verses after they are sent down to you, and call (people) to your Lord, and never become one of those who associate partners with Allah."},"28:88":{"t":"And do not invoke any other god along with Allah. There is no god but He. Everything is going to perish except His Face. He one has the right to judge, and to Him you are to be returned."},"29:1":{"t":"'Alif, Lam, Mim."},"29:2":{"t":"Do people think that they will be left (at ease) only on their saying, \"We believe\" and will not be put to test?"},"29:3":{"t":"And We have surely tested those who were before them. So Allah will surely know the ones who are truthful, and He will surely know the liars."},"29:4":{"t":"Is it that those who are committing evils think that they will escape from Us? Evil is what they decide."},"29:5":{"t":"Whoever hopes for meeting Allah (must be sure that) Allah's appointed time has to come.
